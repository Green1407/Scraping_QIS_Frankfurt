# Scraping_QIS_Frankfurt

The aim of this project is to provide a tool that can automatically read the lecture data from the course catalog of the Goethe University Frankfurt semester by semester. 
The read data is saved, converted into a DataFrame and can finally be exported as individual word files for each lecturer. The Word files contain all the courses and the course information for which the lecturer is responsible.
